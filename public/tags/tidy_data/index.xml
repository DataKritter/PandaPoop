      <description>I’ve been gradually changing my workflows to be more in line with the prinicples of reproducible research. It has been life-changing – I can go back and run analyses from last year on a different computer and…it just works. It’s absolutely magical.
I’m not fully reproducible yet - I shudder to think what someone would do if they came along my Projects folder at this exact moment, but I’m getting closer.</description>

      <description>This is an example of a messy dataset I might receive that needs tidying. Interns measured the length and dorsal girth (measurement around the middle) of several fish over time. Each time they measured the fish, they added a few more lines to the excel sheet for that date. This made data entry very convenient, but isn’t a usable format for data analysis.

 It’s not a problem, though, because we have the Tidyverse!</description>
